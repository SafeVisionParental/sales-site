</h1>

<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. We have a few fundamental principles:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li> 
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li> 
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li> 
</ul> 

<p>Safe Vision Parental Software operates mobile app 'Safe Vision' and website <a href="https://safe.vision/">safe.vision</a>.
  It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information
  we may collect while operating our app and website.</p> 

<h2>1 PURPOSE OF OUR POLICY</h2>
<p>
  <strong>1.1 </strong>
Safe Vision Parental Software Pty Ltd ACN 615 940 899 (<strong>we</strong>,    <strong>us</strong> or <strong>our</strong>) has adopted this Privacy
  Policy to ensure that we have standards in place to protect the Personal
  Information that we collect about individuals that is necessary and
  incidental to:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a) </strong>
  Providing the system and services that we offer; and
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(b) </strong>
  The normal day-to-day operations of our business.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1.2 </strong>
  This Privacy Policy follows the standards of:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a) </strong>
  The Australian Privacy Principles set by the Australian Government for the
  handling of Personal Information under the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth)
  (<strong>Privacy Act</strong>);
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(b) </strong>
  The regulations and principles set by the European Union’s General Data
  Protection Regulation (<strong>GDPR</strong>) with respect to the handling
  of Personal Data of individuals in the European Union; and
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(c) </strong>
  The requirements set by the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy
  Protection Act (<strong>COPPA</strong>) with respect to the handling of
  Personal Information of children under the age of 13 in the United States.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1.3 </strong>
  By publishing this Privacy Policy, we aim to make it easy for our customers
  and the public to understand what Personal Information we collect and
  store, why we do so, how we receive, obtain, store and/or use that
  information, and the rights of control an individual has with respect to
  their Personal Information in our possession.
</p>
<h2>2 WHO AND WHAT THIS POLICY APPLIES TO</h2>
<p>
  <strong>2.1 </strong>
  Our Privacy Policy deals with how we handle “personal information” and
“personal data” as it is defined in the Privacy Act, COPPA and the GDPR (    <strong>Personal Information</strong>).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2.2 </strong>
  We handle Personal Information in our own right and also for and on behalf
  of our customers and users.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2.3 </strong>
  Our Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect about
  businesses or companies, however it does apply to information about the
  people in those businesses or companies which we store. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2.4 </strong>
  The Privacy Policy applies to all forms of information, physical and
digital, whether collected or stored electronically or in hardcopy.    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2.5 </strong>
  If, at any time, an individual provides Personal Information or other
  information about someone other than himself or herself, the individual
  warrants that they have that person’s consent to provide such information
  for the purpose specified.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2.6 </strong>
  For clarity, this Privacy Policy does not apply to non-Personal Information
  that we may collect and disclose to third parties (such as analytics
  information generated from the use of Safe Vision).
</p>

<h2>3 PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CHILDREN</h2>
<p>
  <strong>3.1 </strong>
  We consider the protection of privacy of children very important. We do not
  knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16 without
  obtaining parental consent. If we learn that Personal Information has been
  collected on the service from persons under 16 years of age without
  verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to
  delete such information.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3.2 </strong>
  Parents have significant rights of control over the processing of their
  child’s Personal Information, and may at any time:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a) </strong>
  Review their child’s Personal Information upon reasonable notice, and by no
  later than 28 days of receiving the written request;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(b) </strong>
  Direct us to delete their child’s Personal Information, and refuse to allow
  any further collection or use of the child’s Personal Information;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(c) </strong>
  Agree to only the processing of their child’s Personal Information, and not
  allow disclosure of such Personal Information to third parties;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3.3 </strong>
  We will not require a child to disclose more Personal Information than is
  reasonably necessary to operate Safe Vision.
</p>

<h2>4 THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>
  <strong>4.1 </strong>
  In the course of business, it is necessary for us to collect Personal
  Information. This information allows us to identify who an individual is
  for the purposes of our business, share Personal Information when asked of
  us, contact the individual in the ordinary course of business and transact
  with the individual. Without limitation, the type of information we may
  collect is:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a) </strong>
  <strong>Personal Information.</strong>
  We may collect personal details such as an individual’s name, location,
  date of birth, nationality, family details and other information defined as
  “Personal Information” in the Privacy Act that allows us to identify who
  the individual is;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(b) </strong>
  <strong>Contact Information.</strong>
  We may collect information such as an individual’s email address,
  telephone number, third-party usernames, residential, business and postal
  address and other information that allows us to contact the individual;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(c) </strong>
  <strong>Financial Information.</strong>
  We may collect financial information related to an individual such as any
  bank or credit card details used to transact with us and other information
  that allows us to transact with the individual and/or provide them with our
  services;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(d) </strong>
  <strong>Statistical Information.</strong>
  We may collect information about an individual’s online and offline
  preferences, habits, movements, trends, decisions, associations,
  memberships, finances, purchases and other information for statistical
  purposes; and
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(e) </strong>
  <strong>Information an individual sends us.</strong>
  We may collect any personal correspondence that an individual sends us, or
  that is sent to us by others about the individual’s activities.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4.2 </strong>
  We may collect other Personal Information about an individual, which we
  will maintain in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4.3 </strong>
  We may also collect non-Personal Information about an individual such as
  information regarding their computer, network and browser. This may include
  their IP address. Where non-Personal Information is collected the
  Australian Privacy Principles, COPPA and the GDPR do not apply.
</p>

<h2>5 HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</h2>
<p>
  <strong>5.1 </strong>
  Most information will be collected in association with an individual’s use
  of our Safe Vision software (<strong>Safe Vision</strong>), an enquiry
  about Safe Vision or generally dealing with us. However, we may also
  receive Personal Information from sources such as advertising, an
  individual’s own promotions, public records, mailing lists, contractors,
  staff, recruitment agencies and our business partners. In particular,
  information is likely to be collected as follows:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a) </strong>
  <strong>Registrations/Subscriptions.</strong>
  When an individual registers or subscribes for a service, account,
  connection or other process whereby they enter Personal Information details
  in order to receive or access something, including a transaction;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(b) </strong>
  <strong>Supply. </strong>
  When an individual supplies us with goods or services;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(c) </strong>
  <strong>Contact.</strong>
  When an individual contacts us in any way;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(d) </strong>
  <strong>Access. </strong>
  When an individual accesses us physically we may require them to provide us
  with details for us to permit them such access. When an individual accesses
  us through the internet we may collect information using cookies (if
  relevant – an individual can adjust their browser’s setting to accept or
  reject cookies) or analytical services; and/or
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(e) </strong>
  <strong>Pixel Tags. </strong>
  Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read
  and they tell us whether mail has been opened.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>5.2 </strong>
  As there are many circumstances in which we may collect information both
  electronically and physically, we will endeavour to ensure that an
  individual is always aware of when their Personal Information is being
  collected.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>5.3 </strong>
  Where we obtain Personal Information without an individual’s knowledge
  (such as by accidental acquisition from a customer) we will either delete
  or destroy the information, or inform the individual that we hold such
  information, in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles, COPPA
  and the GDPR.
</p>

<h2>6 WHEN PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED &amp; DISCLOSED</h2>
<p>
  <strong>6.1 </strong>
  In general, the primary principle is that we will not use any Personal
  Information other than for the purpose for which it was collected other
  than with the individual’s permission. The purpose of collection is
  determined by the circumstances in which the information was collected
  and/or submitted.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.2 </strong>
  We will only process Personal Information when we can identify a lawful
  basis to do so. It is always our responsibility to ensure that we can
  demonstrate which lawful basis applies to the particular processing
  purpose.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.3 </strong>
  The most common lawful bases relied upon are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a) </strong>
  <em>Consent</em>
  : we will only rely upon express, clear and informed consent. Any consent
  provided may specify and/or restrict the purpose, and can be withdrawn at
  any time without penalty. We will keep a record of when and how we got
  consent from an individual.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(b) </strong>
  <em>Legitimate interests</em>
  : we will only rely upon an identifiable legitimate interest where we can
  demonstrate that the processing of Personal Information is necessary to
  achieve it by balancing it against the individual’s interests, rights and
  freedoms. We will keep a record of our legitimate interests assessments.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.4 </strong>
  We will retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfil the
  purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period
  is required or permitted by law.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.5 </strong>
  If it is necessary for us to disclose an individual’s Personal Information
  to third parties in a manner compliant with the Australian Privacy
  Principles, COPPA and the GDPR in the course of our business, we will
  inform you that we intend to do so, including the type of businesses we
  disclose to and how they use the Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.6 </strong>
  We will not disclose or sell an individual’s Personal Information to
  unrelated third parties under any circumstances, unless the prior written
  consent of the individual is obtained.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.7 </strong>
  Information is used to enable us to operate our business, especially as it
  relates to an individual. This may include:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a) </strong>
  The provision of goods and services between an individual and us;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(b) </strong>
  Verifying an individual’s identity;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(c) </strong>
  Communicating with an individual about:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>i </strong>
  Their relationship with us;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>ii </strong>
  Our goods and services;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>iii </strong>
  Our own marketing and promotions to customers and prospects;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>iv </strong>
  Competitions, surveys and questionnaires;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(d) </strong>
  Investigating any complaints about or made by an individual, or if we have
  reason to suspect that an individual is in breach of any of our terms and
  conditions or that an individual is or has been otherwise engaged in any
  unlawful activity; and/or
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(e) </strong>
  As required or permitted by any law (including the Privacy Act).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.8 </strong>
  The individual shall have the right to object at any time to the processing
  of their Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, which includes
  profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If we
  receive such a request, we will stop the processing of Personal Information
  for direct marketing purposes immediately without charge or penalty.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.9 </strong>
  There are some circumstances in which we must disclose an individual’s
  information:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a) </strong>
  Where we reasonably believe that an individual may be engaged in
  fraudulent, deceptive or unlawful activity that a governmental authority
  should be made aware of;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(b) </strong>
  As required by any law (including the Privacy Act); and/or
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(c) </strong>
  In order to sell our business (in that we may need to transfer Personal
  Information to a new owner).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.10 </strong>
  We will not disclose an individual’s Personal Information to any entity
  outside of Australia that is in a jurisdiction that does not have a similar
  regime to the Australian Privacy Principles or an implemented and
  enforceable privacy policy similar to this Privacy Policy. We will take
  reasonable steps to ensure that any disclosure to an entity outside of
  Australia will not be made until that entity has agreed in writing with us
  to safeguard Personal Information as we do.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.11 </strong>
  We may utilise third-party service providers to communicate with an
  individual and to store contact details about an individual. These service
  providers may be located outside of Australia.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>6.12 </strong>
  An individual who uses Safe Vision from outside of Australia will be
  sending information (including Personal Information) to Australia where our
  servers are located. That information may then be transferred within
  Australia or back out of Australia to other countries outside of the
  individual’s country of residence, depending on the type of information and
  how it is stored by us. These countries may not necessarily have data
  protection laws as comprehensive or protective as those in your country of
  residence, however our collection, storage and use of Personal Information
  will at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>7 EXTERNAL SERVICES</h2>
<p>
  <strong>7.1 </strong>
  Safe Vision uses the YouTube API services to display videos and video metadata.
  Please review Google Privacy Policy at
  <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a>.
</p>

<h2>8 OPTING “IN” OR “OUT”</h2>
<p>
  <strong>8.1 </strong>
  An individual may opt to not have us collect and/or process their Personal
  Information. This may prevent us from offering them some or all of our
  services and may terminate their access to some or all of the services they
  access with or through us. They will be aware of this when:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a) </strong>
  <strong>Opt In.</strong>
  Where relevant, the individual will have the right to choose to have
  information collected and/or receive information from us (for clarity,
  consent must involve an unambiguous positive action to opt in); or
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(b) </strong>
  <strong>Opt Out.</strong>
  Where relevant, the individual will have the right to choose to exclude
  himself or herself from some or all collection of information and/or
  receiving information from us.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>8.2 </strong>
  If an individual believes that they have received information from us that
  they did not opt in or out to receive, they should contact us using the
  details as set out in section 11 below.
</p>

<h2>9 THE SAFETY &amp; SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
  <strong>9.1 </strong>
  We may appoint a Data Protection Officer to oversee the management of this
  Privacy Policy and compliance with the Australian Privacy Principles, the
  Privacy Act, COPPA and the GDPR. This officer may have other duties within
  our business and also be assisted by internal and external professionals
  and advisors.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>9.2 </strong>
  We will take all reasonable precautions to protect an individual’s Personal
  Information from unauthorised access. This includes appropriately securing
  our physical facilities and electronic networks.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>9.3 </strong>
  We use SSL encryption to store and transfer Personal Information. Despite
  this, the security of online transactions and the security of
  communications sent by electronic means or by post cannot be guaranteed.
  Each individual that provides information to us via the internet or by post
  does so at their own risk. We cannot accept responsibility for misuse or
  loss of, or unauthorised access to, Personal Information where the security
  of information is not within our control.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>9.4 </strong>
  We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any third
  party (including third parties that we are permitted to disclose an
  individual’s Personal Information to in accordance with this policy or any
  applicable laws), unless otherwise required by the Privacy Act, COPPA and
  the GDPR. The collection and use of an individual’s information by such
  third parties may be subject to separate privacy and security policies.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>9.5 </strong>
  If an individual suspects any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to,
  their Personal Information, they should let us know immediately.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>9.6 </strong>
  We are not liable for any loss, damage or claim arising out of another
  person’s use of the Personal Information where we were authorised to
  provide that person with the Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>9.7 </strong>
  Where there is a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful
  destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to,
  Personal Information, then:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(a) </strong>
  We will immediately establish the likelihood and severity of the resulting
  risk to wider rights and freedoms of natural persons;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(b) </strong>
  If we determine there is a risk from the security breach, then we will
  immediately notify the relevant supervisory authority and provide all
  relevant information on the particular breach, and by no later than 72
  hours after having first become aware of the breach;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(c) </strong>
  If we determine there is a high risk from the security breach (a higher
  threshold than set for notifying supervisory authorities), we will
  immediately notify the affected individuals and provide all relevant
  information on the particular breach without undue delay.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>9.8 </strong>
  We will document the facts relating to any security breach, its effects and
  the remedial action taken, and investigate the cause of the breach and how
  to prevent similar situations in the future.
</p>

<h2>10 HOW TO ACCESS, UPDATE AND/OR REMOVE INFORMATION</h2>

  <strong>10.1 </strong>

  has the right to request from us the Personal Information that we have
  about them, and we have an obligation to provide them with such information
  as soon as practicable, and by no later than 28 days of receiving the
  written request. The individual is free to retain and reuse their Personal
  Information for their own purposes. We may be required to transmit the
  Personal Information directly to another organisation if this is
  technically feasible.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10.3 </strong>
  If an individual cannot update their own information, we will correct any
  errors in the Personal Information we hold about an individual within 28
  days of receiving written notice from them about those errors, or two
  months where the request for rectification is complex.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10.4 </strong>
  It is an individual’s responsibility to provide us with accurate and
  truthful Personal Information. We cannot be liable for any information that
  is provided to us that is incorrect.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10.5 </strong>
  Where a request to access Personal Information is manifestly unfounded,
  excessive and/or repetitive, we may refuse to respond or charge an
  individual a reasonable fee for our costs incurred in meeting any of their
  requests to disclose the Personal Information we hold about them. Where we
  refuse to respond to a request, we will explain why to the individual,
  informing them of their right to complain to the supervisory authority and
  to a judicial remedy without undue delay and at the latest within 28 days.
</p>

  GDPR;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(e) </strong>

  obligation; and/or
</p>
<p>
